The Ann Arbor Ruby Brigade is a monthly meetup in downtown Ann Arbor
for anyone who is interested in the Ruby programming language. All
skill levels are welcome. Topics will vary from month to month and
presentation submissions or suggestions for topics are welcome. You
can also stay up to date with the group on our [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/group/a2rb) and on
our [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/a2rb).

Meetings are held on the last Tuesday of every month in the offices of
Atomic Object.
